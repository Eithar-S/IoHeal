# IoHeal

“IoHeal” is an IoT device designed to support patients during their post-surgery recovery. After surgery, patients require ongoing care to ensure proper healing. This is exactly what “IoHeal” provides—it helps patients take care of themselves effectively. For example, it monitors the patient’s heart rate to ensure they’re not overexerting themselves, reminds them to take medication on time, and notifies them when it's time to visit their doctor.
